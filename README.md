# KFCOMApplication
An Android application created for members of Karate for Christ of Michigan.  This was created as a final project for the Programming Languages class.
I created this application for my martial arts organization, Karate for Christ of Michigan.  I still continue to work on this, as I want to one day release it on the iOS App Store and Google Play Store.  It is probably the largest project that I've worked on.
The code is separated between multiple files, and was programmed using Android Studio.
In order to view the code that I have written, you need to follow this navigation:
app->src->main.
Within the "main" file, there are two folders of interest.  
The "java/com/mycompany/kfcomapplication" folder holds all of the code behind each of the pages and sections of the application.
The "res" folder holds all of the XML code behind the app.
